Network File System Setup on two virtual machines

NFS (Network File System) lets you access remote systems from your system (only shared resources) under some permissions.
For setting up of NFS server , I created two virtual machines (Ubuntu 16.04) using VMWare and created a NFS Server between them.
All the steps for setting NFS , changing IP Address for two virtual machines etc are mentioned in the pdf file uploaded.
